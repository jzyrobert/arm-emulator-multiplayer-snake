#Programming III: Group 1 C Group Project

Welcome to our repository for our solutions to the C Group Project.

##Running the extension
The extension is found in src/extension. After running `make`, running the generated file called `snake` will start the game.

Running `server` will start the server - you can now connect to the given IP address and port on your favourite device using your favourite browser - so long as you are on the same network as the device running the network - to control your snake.

If you have an Android device, you can similarly install the (Snake Wars Controller App)[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cproject.group1.snakewars] and connect as above.

Finally, running `botsonly` will provide you with a fun non-interactive simulation in your terminal for you to enjoy watching.

##Licenses
Please note that the folder `src/extension/fannF` contains the (Fast Artificial Neural Network Library)[http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/]. We did not write this, and you can find the license under which we have used it in the `fannF` directory.
